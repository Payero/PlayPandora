PreHistory:
-----------
The original developer has abandoned the project, therefore this GitHub repository is intended to give a second life to Anesidora project by collaborating with other developers.

This repository was originally imported from here:
https://code.google.com/p/pandora-extension/

PostHistory?:
--------------
As mentioned above this project was abandoned by the original authors (of anesidora.tk). It was then exported to Github from code.google.com (without the GPLv2 Lisence) I have forked that repo to generate a Firefox version of the addon. I have also included the orignial GPLv2 License from the original project

I've created a Firefox version and continued to update the Chrome version. The UI should be much more responsive now and aims to be flexible to varying sizes (specified on the options page)

Developing:
------------
In order to develop or install this as a developer you will need to copy one of the manifest.json files into the `json/` directory. For example `manifest.json.firefox` => `json/manifest.json`.
